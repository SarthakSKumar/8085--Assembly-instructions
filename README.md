| The Intel 8085 ("eighty-eighty-five") is an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Intel and introduced in March 1976. It is software-binary compatible with the     |
| more-famous Intel 8080 with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output features.                                 |

The goal of this project is to impliment a Calculator in a 8085 assembly.

The repo contains all the basic arithmetic operations that can be performed by the 8085 ALU.
